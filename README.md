# YouTube Video Batch Downloader

Sometimes you might want to download a YouTube video: maybe you don't have a stable internet connection to watch it without interruptions, or sometimes the video is controversial and is likely to be taken down in the future.

There are a lot of websites that allow you to download YouTube videos. Many of these websites are a scam, most of them are filled with ads and pop-ups.

Almost all of these websites put a limit on the maximum number of videos that you can download per day, or per session. This is usually done to prevent DoS attacks.

Also, you have to manually copy and paste video URLs one-by-one into the website, which is a lot of work.

# Using this tool,

* You can download YouTube videos/shorts locally.

* You do not have to visit sus websites and expose your PC to risks.

* You can download as many videos as you want, with max video quality.

* You can queue URLs and they'll download one-by-one, automatically.

# How to use
